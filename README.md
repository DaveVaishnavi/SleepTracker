# SleepTracker

The way usage of phones and laptops is increasing, the sleep schedule of all age
groups has experienced a hit. Students spending 10-12 hours of a day staring at
the screen seemingly sacrifice a good amount of their deep sleep and therefore,
invite mental illnesses and if not catered to, these sleeping irregularities can
cause physical illnesses as well. They often try to manage their sleep schedule in
order to keep a track of our sleeping hours but owing to our busy schedules, we
fail to do that. Here, we come to your rescue. We have developed a web app
that allows a user to keep a track of his sleeping hours with our platform, get a
pictorial representation of his day-by-day sleep hours, and an intelligent
suggestion about changing the sleep schedule.
